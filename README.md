# No-Name-Engine
A Rendering/Game engine build on OpenGL in C++. I know it's messy and not optimised but I've done this in the name of fun and learning new technologies.

# Dependencies
I use GLFW to provide OpenGL, GLAD to allow OpenGL to interact with different GPUs, GLM to deal with matrices and projections, and stb_image.h to deal with image processing.
